<h1 align="center">GNSS Reducer</h1>

GNSS Reducer is a user-friendly tool for processing GNSS observation data. This application allows users to drag and drop CSV files, average GNSS coordinates for paired observations, and export processed data for streamlined analysis and use.

## Features
- Drag-and-Drop CSV Processing: Easily import your GNSS observation data files.
- Automatic Averaging: Calculates averaged Easting, Northing, and Height values for GNSS observation pairs.
- Scaling: Apply projection and height scale factors.
- Friendly GUI: Built with Tkinter for an intuitive and minimalistic user interface.
- Automatic File Generation: Processed results are saved in a new CSV file with clear formatting.

## Compatiblity <br>

GNSS Reducer is optimised for specific input and output workflows:
- Input Optimisation: This program is designed for CSV files generated by **Emlid** GNSS devices, ensuring seamless compatiblity with their data structure.

- Output Optimisation: The exported CSV files are structured for **direct import into LISCAD**, a popular surveying software, simplifying further processing and analysis.

## Installation
### For Windows Executable Users
1. Download the latest ```.exe``` release from the Releases page.
2. Run the executable file (```GNSS-Reducer-X.X.X.exe```) directly. No installation required!

### For Python Users
1. Install Python 3.10+
2. Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install tkinterdnd2
```
3. Clone the repository:
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/beroono/GNSS-Reducer.git
```
4. Navigate to the project directory and run the program:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage
1. Launch the application (executable or as above)
2. Drag and drop a CSV file containing GNSS observation data into the application window.
3. Wait for the processing to complete. The application will generate a new CSV file in the same directory as the original file, with ```-GPS-Import``` appaneded to the filename.

### Example:
#### Input File
|  Name  |  Easting |  Northing | Elevation | Code |
|:------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:|:----:|
| PM123A | 500000.1 | 6000000.2 |    30.5   | Obs1 |
| PM123B | 500000.3 | 6000000.4 | 30.7      | Obs2 |

#### Output File
|  Name  |  Easting |  Northing | Elevation | Code |
|:------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:|:----:|
| PM123-GPS| 500000.2 | 6000000.3 |    30.6  | Obs1 |

> Note: Ensure the input CSV file adheres to the structure generated by Emlid devices for optimal results. The output is tailored for LISCAD imports, with column formatting and headers adjusted accordingly.
